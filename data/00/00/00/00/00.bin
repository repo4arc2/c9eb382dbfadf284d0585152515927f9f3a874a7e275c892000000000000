Mmm. Not exactly.

I might be able to help with that.
I've stolen more from worse.

Seriously?
You really are from another planet.

118

We believe the only way to stop Ultron
is to separate his body from the stones.

But this Ultron could be hiding
anywhere in the Multiverse?

-Yes.
-Behind an army of killer robots?

-And armed with a full set of stones?

Well, obviously the first step
would be finding him.

Well, I'm not one to brag,

130
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:18,208
but I've been told that I excel
at attracting unwanted attention.

Oh. That will come in handy.

And after we recover the stones,
we destroy them.

go about destroying the...

All right, everyone, you all know
what to do. You know the plan.

Get the Soul Stone and get it to Gamora.

140
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,500
We'll hold the line.
And then she'll unleash the Crusher.

00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,416
With some luck, we'll be home for dinner.

Okay, wait. Slow down a little bit.

There's a few people in the room
that don't understand.

Not me. I get it.
But for them, maybe repeat it.

Hmm. You're ready.
It's showtime, my friends. Good luck.

Cousin, what are you doing?

00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,708
The Watcher owes us this.

325
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:12,166
With these stones,
we could fix our worlds, our lives.

326
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,541
T'Challa, Thor,

327
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,916
are you gonna turn down the one thing
guaranteed to save your homes?

328
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,208
Peggy, you can be with your fella again.

Strange, you more than anyone
know that this is it.

This is our only chance.

331
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,833
Hand over the stones, cousin.

332
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,208
I'm not your cousin.

333
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,958
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

if they escape--

I'll watch.

And then there was one.

I won't go back there. My world is...

You are more than that to me.

they are everything to me.

you told me all your secrets.
